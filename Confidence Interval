Topics: Confidence Intervals



 



1.      For each of the following statements,
indicate whether it is True/False. If
false, explain why.



 



I.       
The sample
size of the survey should at least be a fixed percentage of the population size
in order to produce representative results.



Ans)    False. 



The results depend on the
size(n) of the sample. The sample size should have at least 30 observations.



 



II.    
The
sampling frame is a list of every item that appears in a survey sample,
including those that did not respond to questions.



Ans)    False. 



The sampling frame is a list of all the items in the target
population from which the sample is selected.



III.  
Larger
surveys convey a more accurate impression of the population than smaller
surveys.



Ans)    True.



 Large sample size will result in less standard
deviation compared to small sample size. Thus we can say larger sample is more
accurate.



 



2.     
PC
Magazine asked all of its readers to participate in a
survey of their satisfaction with different brands of electronics. In the 2004
survey, which was included in an issue of the magazine that year, more than
9000 readers rated the products on a scale from 1 to 10. The magazine reported
that the average rating assigned by 225 readers to a Kodak compact digital
camera was 7.5. For this product, identify the following:



 



A.   
The population



B.     
The parameter
of interest



C.    
The sampling
frame



D.   
The sample
size



E.     
The sampling
design



F.     
Any
potential sources of bias or other problems with the survey or sample



Ans)    A: Readers of the magazine =9000



            B:  Rating of the
camera(7.5)



            C: Sampling frame: All readers of the issue where the
survey was included.



            D: 225



            E: Voluntary response



            F: It is possible that only those who were particularly
pleased or only who are displeased with the product participated in the survey
which can makes the results unreliable.



 



3.      For each of the following statements,
indicate whether it is True/False. If
false, explain why.



 



I.       
If the 95%
confidence interval for the average purchase of customers at a department store
is $50 to $110, then $100 is a plausible value for the population mean at this
level of confidence.



Ans)    True. 



Confidence interval identifies
the collection of values for the population parameter that are consistent with
the observed sample.       



 



II.    
If the 95%
confidence interval for the number of moviegoers who purchase concessions is
30% to 45%, this means that fewer than half of all moviegoers purchase
concessions.



Ans)    False. 



            We have evidence in that direction but we cannot confirm
100% based on this data.  We have to
consider the values out of this range(i.e. more than 95% confidance interval).



 



III.  
The 95%
Confidence-Interval for μ only applies if the sample data are nearly
normally distributed.



Ans)    False.



            We should have a moderately large sample(usually at least
larger than 30 for many cases), the central limit theorem implies that the
sampling distribution is normal regardless of the data itself. 



 



 



4.     
What are
the chances that 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 

 
?



 



A.   
¼ 



B.     
½ 



C.    
¾ 



D.   
1



Ans)    B.



            This is pure assumption. There
is a 50% chance that the sample mean(
 
) is greater than the population
mean(µ).



 



 



5.     
In January
2005, a company that monitors Internet traffic (WebSideStory) reported that its
sampling revealed that the Mozilla Firefox browser launched in 2004 had grabbed
a 4.6% share of the market.



 



I.       
If the
sample were based on 2,000 users, could Microsoft conclude that Mozilla has a
less than 5% share of the market?



Ans)    here, 



            
 
=0.046, n=2000, 
 
= 1.96, q= 0.954



95% confidence interval for the proportion of web users using Mozilla is 



            
 
± Z
 
 = 
 
± 1.96
 
 =0.046±0.00918 = 0.0368- 0.0551.



 



II.    
WebSideStory
claims that its sample includes all the daily Internet users. If that’s the
case, then can Microsoft conclude that Mozilla has a less than 5% share of the
market?



Ans)    In this case, we have data on
the entire population and the sample value accurately reflects the population
number. Thus we can conclude that the share is less than 5%.



 



 



6.     
A book
publisher monitors the size of shipments of its textbooks to university
bookstores. For a sample of texts used at various schools, the 95% confidence
interval for the size of the shipment was 250 ± 45 books. Which, if any, of the
following interpretations of this interval are correct?



 



A.   
All
shipments are between 205 and 295 books.



Ans)    Incorrect.



            The interval of (205,295)
is for 95% confidence not for 100%.



B.     
95% of shipments
are between 205 and 295 books.



Ans)    Incorrect.



            The interval doesn’t
describe individual shipments.



C.    
The
procedure that produced this interval generates ranges that hold the population
mean for 95% of samples.



Ans)    Correct.



            95% of intervals created
in this way contain the true population mean.



D.   
If we get
another sample, then we can be 95% sure that the mean of this second sample is
between 205 and 295.



Ans)    Incorrect.



            The interval doesn’t
describe the mean of another sample.



E.     
We can be
95% confident that the range 160 to 340 holds the population mean.



Ans)    Incorrect.



            The interval doesn’t
correspond to a 95% confidence level.



 



7.     
Which is
shorter: a 95% z-interval or a 95% t-interval for μ if we know that σ =s?



 



A.   
The z-interval
is shorter



B.     
The t-interval
is shorter



C.    
Both are
equal



D.   
We cannot
say



Ans)    A. the Z- interval is
shorter.



 



Questions 8 and 9 are based on the following:
To prepare a report on the economy, analysts need to estimate the percentage of
businesses that plan to hire additional employees in the next 60 days.



 



8.     
How many
randomly selected employers (minimum number) must we contact in order to
guarantee a margin of error of no more than 4% (at 95% confidence)?



 



A.   
600



B.     
400



C.    
550



D.   
1000



Ans) here,       n=number of
employers,       Assume  
 
=0.5,
 
=0.5 Margin
of Error=0.04



            For  95% confidence interval, the critical value
Z= 1.96



                        ME = Z * 
 




                        



                        0.04 = 1.96 *

 




                        n= 
 
 =
 
 =600 =A



            



 



 



9.     
Suppose we
want the above margin of error to be based on a 98% confidence level. What
sample size (minimum) must we now use?



 



A.   
1000



B.     
757



C.    
848



D.   
543



Ans)    Z=
2.576



            0.04 = 2.326 * 
 




 



            n= 
 
 = 
 
= 845.35 = C
