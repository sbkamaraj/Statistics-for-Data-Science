The
Java computer language, developed by Sun Microsystems, has the advantage that
its programs can run on types of hardware ranging from mainframe computers all
the way down to handheld computing devices or even smart phones. A test of 100
randomly selected programmers revealed that 71 preferred Java to their other
most used computer languages. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the
proportion of all programmers in the population from which the sample was
selected who prefer Java.

 = 
 
 = 71/100 = 0.71



        
 
 ± Z
 
 =  0.71 ±
1.96
 




        => (0.71-1.96*0.045, 0.71+1.96*0.045)= (0.6218,0.798)



 



 



2.      
A
small British computer-game firm, Eidos Interactive PLC, stunned the U.S.- and
Japan-dominated market for computer games when it introduced Lara Croft, an
Indiana Jones-like adventuress. The successful product took two years to
develop. One problem was whether Lara should have a swinging ponytail, which
was decided after taking a poll. If in a random sample of 200 computer-game
enthusiasts, 161 thought she should have a swinging ponytail (a computer
programmer’s nightmare todesign), construct a 95% confidence interval for the
proportion of enthusiasts who would like here to have a swinging ponytail, in
this market. If the decision to incur the high additional programming cost was
to be made if p>0.90, was the right decision made (when Eidos went
ahead with the ponytail)?



Ans)               
 
 = 
 
 = 0.8



                        
 
 ± Z
 
 =  0.8 ±
1.96
 




                        (0.8 -1.96*0.02, 0.8+1.96*0.02)= (0.7608,0.8392)



But the CI is in (0.7608,0.8392)



Therefore, the decision to go
ahead to have the ponytail is right.



 



 



3.      
According
to a survey published in the Financial Times, 56% of executives at
Britain’s top 500 companies are less willing than they had been five years ago
to sacrifice their family lifestyle for their career. If the survey consisted
of a random sample of 40 executives, give a 95% confidence interval for the
proportion of executives less willing to sacrifice their family lifestyle.



Ans)               56% of 40 executives= 22

 =  0.55 ±

                        (0.55 -1.96*0.078, 0.55+1.96*0.078)=
(0.396,0.704)



 



4.      
A
survey of 5,250 business travelers worldwide conducted by OAG Business Travel
Lifestyle indicated that 91% of business travelers consider legroom the most
important in-flight feature. (Angle of seat recline and food service were
second and third, respectively.) Give a 95% confidence interval for the
proportion of all business travelers who consider legroom the most important
feature.



Ans)               91% of 5250 is 4777.5

                        (0.91-1.96*0.0039, 0.91+1.96*0.0039)= (0.9023,0.9177)



5.      
According
to Money, 60% of men have significant balding by age 50.24 If this
finding is based on a random sample of 1,000 men of age 50, give a 95% confidence
interval for the proportion of men of 50 who show some balding.



Ans)               60% of 1000 is 600
