Q3) Three Coins are tossed, find the probability that two heads and one tail are obtained?
Ans>  The Sample Space for above Problem is
S = (HHH,HHT,HTH,THH,HTT,THT,TTH,HHH)
Interested event = (HHT,HTH,THH)
Therefore, Reqd. Probability = 3/8

Q4)  Two Dice are rolled, find the probability that sum is
a)	Equal to 1
b)	Less than or equal to 4
c)	Sum is divisible by 2and  3

Ans> Sample Space =
11	12	13	14	15	16
21	22	23	24	25	26
31	32	33	34	35	36
41	42	43	44	45	46
51	52	53	54	55	56
61	62	63	64	65	66

a>	Zero
b>	Interested Event=(11,12,13,21,22,31)
Therefore Reqd. Probability = 6/36
c>	Interested Event = (15,24,33,42,51,66)
Therefore Reqd. Probability = 6/36

Q6) Calculate the Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child 
Below are the probabilities of count of candies for children(ignoring the nature of the child-Generalized view)
CHILD	Candies count	Probability
A	1	0.015
B	4	0.20
C	3	0.65
D	5	0.005
E	6	0.01
F	2	0.120
Child A – probability of having 1 candy = 0.015.
Child B – probability of having 4 candies = 0.20
Expected Value = ∑xP(x) = 1*0.015+ 4*0.20 +3*0.65 +5*0.005 + 6*0.01 + 2*0.120
                                          = 3.09


Q7) Calculate Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation, Range &     comment about the values / draw inferences, for the given dataset
-	For Points,Score,Weigh>
Find Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation, and Range and also Comment about the values/ Draw some inferences.
  
	Points	Score	Weigh
Mean	3.59	3.22	17.85
Median	3.69	3.33	17.71
Variance	0.29	0.96	3.19
Standard Deviation	0.53	0.98	1.79
Range	2.76 - 4.93
	1.513 - 5.424
	14.5 - 22.9


Inference Drawn:
•	The mean is useful for spotting trends in the data because we can compare means over a time period to spot trends. The mean is the most common measure of central tendency.

•	The median divides a sample of data in half; it is the middle score. The median is a useful statistic if we think our data have some extreme cases. The median is not impacted by extreme cases, but the mean is.

•	
Q8) Calculate Expected Value for the problem below
a)	The weights (X) of patients at a clinic (in pounds), are
108, 110, 123, 134, 135, 145, 167, 187, 199
Assume one of the patients is chosen at random. What is the Expected Value of the Weight of that patient?
Ans>EV = ∑X/n = 1308/9 = 145.33

Q9) Calculate Skewness, Kurtosis & draw inferences on the following data
Cars speed and distance 
 
For Speed Column
> attach(a)
> skewness(speed)
[1] -0.1139548 ## left skewness
> kurtosis(speed)
[1] 2.422853    ## negative Kurtosis





 
Skewness is negative, that tells us that the distribution is skewed towards left. Mean of distribution is less than the Median. Kurtosis Value is less than 3, that tells us that the distribution has broad peak and thin tails as evident from the histogram.







For dist column
> attach(a)
> skewness(dist)
[1] 0.7824835 ## positive/Right skewness
> kurtosis(dist)
[1] 3.248019 ##positive Kurtosis 


 
Skewness is positive, that tells us that the distribution is skewed towards right. Mean of distribution is more than the Median. Kurtosis Value is more than 3, that tells us that the distribution has sharp peak and wide tails as evident from the histogram.












For 
SP and Weight(WT

 
For SP:
 
 
Skewness is positive, that tells us that the distribution is skewed towards right. Mean of distribution is more than the Median. Kurtosis Value is more than 3, that tells us that the distribution has sharp peak and wide tails as evident from the histogram.
For WT:
 
 
Skewness is negative, that tells us that the distribution is skewed towards left. Mean of distribution is less than the Median.Kurtosis Value is more than 3, that tells us that the distribution has sharp peak and wide tails as evident from the histogram.


Q10) Draw inferences about the following boxplot & histogram

 
The Distribution is Right Skewed. Mean > Median.
 
The above boxplot suggests that the distribution has lots of outliers towards upper extreme.

 Q 24) A Government company claims that an average light bulb lasts 270 days. A researcher randomly selects 18 bulbs for testing. The sampled bulbs last an average of 260 days, with a standard deviation of 90 days. If the CEO's claim were true, what is the probability that 18 randomly selected bulbs would have an average life of no more than 260 days
Hint: 
rcodept(tscore,df)  
df degrees of freedom
µ = 270, n= 18, x bar = 260, s = 90
t score = (x bar - µ)/(s/sqrt(n))
=(260 – 270)/(90/sqrt(18))
=-10/21.23
=-0.47
Required Probability = 0.32
